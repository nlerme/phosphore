**Presentation**
Phopshore is yet another minimalistic 3D graphics engine distributed under GPL v3.0 license. The rendering is performed with uniform material and a single light located at long range distance for convenience. Handcrafted objects are avalailable, can be loaded with files (PLY and OBJ formats are only currently available) or randomly generated using Gemini (the variable *GeminiAPIKey* must be assigned with your api key). The Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern is used for the graphical user interface.

**Compilation**
This project is written in Java. It is strongly recommended to use a compiler whose version is above 1.5. Files can be compiled by typing *make* in a terminal.
