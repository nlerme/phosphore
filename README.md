# Presentation
Phopshore is yet another minimalistic 3D graphics engine distributed under GPL v3.0 license. Phong's rendering is used with uniform material and a single light located at long range distance. Handcrafted objects are avalailable or can be loaded (PLY and OBJ formats are only currently available). The Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern is used for the graphical user interface.

# Compilation
This project is written in Java. It is strongly recommended to use a compiler whose version is above 1.5. Files can be compiled by typing *make* in a terminal.
